## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies (Blocking)

- Setup (T001-T003) before all other phases
- All Tests (T004-T011) before Core Implementation (T012-T021)
- Time Event model (T012) before SSE service (T016)
- Connection State models (T013-T015) before frontend components (T026-T042)
- SSE service (T016) before SSE endpoint (T020)
- Asset embedding (T022) before static serving (T017)
- Router config (T023) blocks final integration
- Frontend build (T022) before frontend tests (T045)
- UI Generation tasks (T033-T042) before Polish phase (T043-T049)

### Sequential Dependencies (Same File)

- T004-T005: Same test file (test_static_routes.rs)
- T018-T019: Same file (src/routes/pages.rs)  
- T020-T021: Same file (src/routes/api.rs)
- T026-T042: Frontend components interdependent
- T037-T038: Both stores work together for state management

## Parallel Example

### Phase 3.2 - Parallel Test Writing
```bash
# Launch T004-T011 together (all different files):
Task: "Contract test GET / (main page) in tests/integration/test_static_routes.rs"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/time/stream (SSE endpoint) in tests/integration/test_sse_stream.rs"  
Task: "Integration test complete user journey in tests/integration/test_user_journey.rs"
Task: "Integration test connection loss recovery in tests/integration/test_connection_recovery.rs"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Parallel Model Development
```bash
# Launch T012-T015 together (different components):
Task: "Time Event model with UK formatting in src/models/time_event.rs"
Task: "Connection State types in src/models/connection_state.rs"
Task: "Frontend Connection State management in frontend/src/lib/stores/connection.ts"
Task: "Frontend Navigation State management in frontend/src/lib/stores/navigation.ts"
```

### Phase 3.5 - Parallel Frontend Development
```bash

Task: "Svelte store for connection state management in frontend/src/lib/stores/connection.ts"
Task: "Dark theme CSS styling in frontend/src/app.css"
Task: "Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts in frontend/src/lib/styles/layout.css"
```

## Notes

### TDD Requirements
- All contract tests (T004-T007) must be written and failing before ANY endpoint implementation
- Integration tests (T008-T011) must be written before running full scenarios
- Unit tests (T033-T035) written in parallel with implementation for rapid feedback

### File Organization
- [P] tasks target different files with no shared dependencies
- Sequential tasks modify the same files and must be completed in order
- Frontend and backend development can proceed in parallel after models are defined

### Validation Gates

- After T011: All tests must be failing (red state)
- After T021: All contract tests must pass (green state)  
- After T042: Frontend UI components and stores implemented
- After T049: Complete quickstart scenarios must pass

### Performance Targets

- T046 validates: <50MB memory usage, <1ms response times, 1000+ concurrent SSE connections
- T049 validates: Single binary deployment, asset embedding working, UK date format correct

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts** ✓:
   - Each endpoint (/, /about, /api/time/stream, /health) → contract test [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model** ✓:
   - Time Event entity → model creation task [P]
   - Connection State entity → model + frontend store tasks [P]
   - Navigation State → frontend store task [P]
   
3. **From Quickstart Scenarios** ✓:
   - Each user story → integration test [P]
   - Complete user journey, connection recovery, mobile, multiple tabs
   
4. **From Technical Context** ✓:
   - SvelteKit + TypeScript setup
   - Asset embedding build process
   - Mobile responsive requirements
   - Performance and memory constraints

5. **From UI Code Generation** ✓:
   - Real-time clock display components
   - Connection status indicators with color coding
   - SSE client with auto-reconnection
   - Svelte stores for state management
   - Responsive design and accessibility
