# Feature Specification: SSE Time Broadcasting Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-experimental-application-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "experimental application to see what can be done with server sent events. The backend should send and event once every 10 seconds containing the date and time. The user interface should look modern and have a dark theme. The user interface should have a nav bar with the title of the application and a link to an about page. The user interface main page should display the date time sent from the backend."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A user visits the experimental SSE application to observe real-time data streaming capabilities. They see a modern, dark-themed interface that automatically updates with server-sent timestamp data every 10 seconds without manual refresh. Users can navigate between the main time display page and an informational about page.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user opens the application, **When** they land on the main page, **Then** they see a modern dark-themed interface with a navigation bar containing the app title and about link
2. **Given** a user is on the main page, **When** 10 seconds pass, **Then** the displayed date/time automatically updates with fresh data from the server
3. **Given** a user is on the main page, **When** they click the about link in the navigation, **Then** they navigate to an about page with application information
4. **Given** a user is on the about page, **When** they navigate back to main, **Then** they return to the live time display which continues updating every 10 seconds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the server connection is lost or interrupted?
- How does the system handle initial page load before the first 10-second event?
- What occurs if the user has multiple browser tabs open with the application?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST broadcast current date and time data every 10 seconds via server-sent events
- **FR-002**: System MUST display received timestamp data on the main page in real-time without user interaction
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a navigation bar with application title and about page link
- **FR-004**: System MUST present a modern user interface with dark theme styling
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to navigate between main time display and about page
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain continuous time updates on the main page regardless of navigation history
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a red banner at the top of the page when SSE connection is lost and automatically clear the banner when connection is restored
- **FR-008**: System MUST be accessible via HTTP with no authentication, login, or security requirements
- **FR-009**: System MUST format and display date and time data using UK date format (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Time Event**: Real-time timestamp data broadcast every 10 seconds, containing current date and time
- **Navigation State**: User's current page location (main time display or about page)
