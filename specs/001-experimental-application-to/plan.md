# Implementation Plan: SSE Time Broadcasting Application

**Branch**: `001-experimental-application-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/omilton/work/axum-sse/specs/001-experimental-application-to/spec.md`

## Summary
Primary requirement: Real-time time broadcasting via Server-Sent Events with modern dark-themed UI. Technical approach: Rust backend with Axum for SSE endpoints, SvelteKit frontend embedded as static assets, single binary deployment with mobile-responsive design.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+
**Primary Dependencies**: Axum 0.7+, Tokio, Tower middleware, SvelteKit, TypeScript
**Storage**: N/A (no persistence required)  
**Testing**: cargo test, vitest (frontend), integration tests for SSE endpoints
**Target Platform**: Linux/Windows/macOS servers, web browsers (mobile-compatible)
**Project Type**: web (frontend embedded in backend binary)  
**Performance Goals**: <1ms response times, 1000+ concurrent SSE connections, 10-second broadcast intervals
**Constraints**: <50MB memory usage, single binary deployment, no external dependencies
**Scale/Scope**: Experimental application, 2-3 routes, SSE streaming, static asset serving

### UI Code Generation Strategy
**Frontend Architecture**: SvelteKit with TypeScript for reactive component development
**State Management**: Svelte stores pattern for connection state and navigation management
**SSE Integration**: EventSource API with custom event handling and auto-reconnection logic
**Component Pattern**: Composition-based architecture with scoped CSS styling
**Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts
**Connection Feedback**: Real-time visual indicators (green=connected, red=disconnected, yellow=connecting)
**Asset Pipeline**: SvelteKit build output embedded via build.rs and include_dir! macro
**Accessibility**: Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
**Loading States**: Progressive enhancement with loading indicators and error boundaries

**Modern Dark Theme Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-20):
- **Design System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming (`--bg-primary: #0f0f23`, `--accent-gradient`)
- **Color Palette**: Deep dark backgrounds with purple/blue gradient accents for modern aesthetic
- **Visual Effects**: Glass morphism with backdrop filters, layered shadows, and translucent surfaces
- **Typography**: Enhanced font hierarchy with improved weights, letter spacing, and modern font stacks
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced button states with transforms, hover effects, and gradient styling
- **Component Styling**: Cards with gradient borders, modern spacing, and improved visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first with improved touch targets and optimized layouts
- **Performance**: Optimized CSS with efficient transitions and reduced reflows

**SPA Architecture Implementation** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-21):

- **Client-Side Routing**: SvelteKit configured with static adapter and `fallback: 'index.html'` for true SPA behavior
- **Persistent State Management**: localStorage-based datetime persistence across navigation with stale detection
- **Enhanced Connection Stores**: Integrated datetime management with SSE connection state for coordinated updates
- **Backend Route Optimization**: SPA fallback routing with dedicated `/_app/*` asset handlers and proper path reconstruction
- **Asset Embedding Strategy**: Fresh build process with `cargo clean` ensuring up-to-date embedded assets
- **UI State Persistence**: 3-panel layout displaying current time, last received time, and persistence status
- **Browser Safety**: localStorage availability checks and graceful degradation for unsupported environments
- **Connection Coordination**: `pingWithTime` method synchronizing both connection and datetime stores simultaneously

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Memory Safety First ✅
- Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety by default
- No unsafe code blocks planned for this simple application
- Resource cleanup automatic via RAII patterns

### II. API-First Design ✅  
- SSE endpoint contract defined before implementation
- Event stream patterns consistent with SSE standards
- Simple HTTP/SSE API, no versioning needed for experimental app

### III. Test-First Development ✅
- Unit tests for time formatting logic
- Integration tests for SSE endpoint streaming
- Frontend tests for connection state handling
- TDD approach mandatory per constitution

### IV. Static Asset Embedding ✅
- SvelteKit build output embedded at compile time
- Single binary deployment achieved
- Asset routing via Axum's routing system

### V. Performance by Default ✅
- Async/await throughout backend implementation
- SSE connections designed for 1000+ concurrent clients
- Memory usage target <50MB aligns with constraints

**Structure Decision**: Web application with embedded frontend (Option 2 modified for embedded assets)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- SSE endpoint contract → contract test task [P]
- Static route contracts → static serving test tasks [P]
- Time Event entity → time formatting model task [P]
- Connection State entity → frontend state management task [P]
- Each user story from quickstart → integration test task
- UI code generation → component and store creation tasks [P]
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass (TDD approach)

**UI Code Generation Tasks**:
- Real-time clock display component with prominent time formatting
- Connection status indicators with color-coded visual feedback  
- SSE EventSource wrapper with auto-reconnection and exponential backoff
- Svelte stores for connection state and navigation management
- Component composition layouts with responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Accessible design patterns with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Loading state management and progressive enhancement
- TypeScript interfaces for component props and state management

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Setup: Cargo project, SvelteKit build integration, dependencies
- Tests: Contract tests for SSE, static serving, connection handling
- Backend: SSE streaming, time formatting, static asset embedding
- Frontend: SvelteKit pages, SSE client, connection state UI
- UI Generation: Component creation, store implementation, responsive styling
- Integration: Build pipeline, asset embedding, routing
- Polish: Error handling, mobile styling, performance optimization

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Frontend and backend contract tests [P]
- Time formatting and connection state logic [P]
- SvelteKit development and Rust backend [P] (different codebases)
- CSS styling and SSE implementation [P]

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Key Dependencies**:
- Frontend build output required for asset embedding
- SSE endpoint must be implemented before integration tests
- Contract tests must be written and failing before implementation
- Mobile CSS requires base component structure

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
