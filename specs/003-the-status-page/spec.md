# Feature Specification: OS Information on Status Page

**Feature Branch**: `003-the-status-page`  
**Created**: 22 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The status page should include information about the os"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request: Add OS information to existing status page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users viewing status page
   ‚Üí Actions: view OS information alongside existing metrics
   ‚Üí Data: operating system details, version, architecture
   ‚Üí Constraints: integrate with existing status page layout
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Display as much OS detail as possible including name, version, architecture, kernel version]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: OS info loaded once since it doesn't change during runtime]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: user views enhanced status page with OS details
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí OS information display requirements
   ‚Üí Integration with existing metrics
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí OS Information entity with relevant attributes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved - spec ready for implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning and implementation)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator or developer monitoring server health, I want to see operating system information on the status page so that I can understand the environment context of the metrics being displayed and make informed decisions about system compatibility and troubleshooting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user navigates to the server status page, **When** the page loads, **Then** OS information should be prominently displayed alongside existing metrics
2. **Given** the status page is displaying metrics, **When** a user views the OS section, **Then** they should see clear, readable operating system details
3. **Given** multiple users access the status page, **When** they view OS information, **Then** all users should see consistent and accurate OS details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OS information cannot be determined or accessed?
- How does the system handle different operating system types (Linux distributions, Windows, macOS)?
- Should OS information update if the underlying system changes during runtime?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display operating system information on the status page
- **FR-002**: System MUST show as much OS detail as possible including name, version, architecture, kernel version, and other relevant system identifiers
- **FR-003**: OS information MUST be presented in a user-friendly, readable format
- **FR-004**: OS information section MUST integrate seamlessly with existing status page layout
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle cases where OS information is unavailable gracefully
- **FR-006**: OS information display MUST be accessible to all users who can view the status page
- **FR-007**: System MUST load OS information once on page initialization since OS details do not change during runtime

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OS Information**: Represents operating system details including name, version, architecture, and other relevant system identifiers that help users understand the server environment
