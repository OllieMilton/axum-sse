# Research: OS Information Collection

## Decision: sysinfo Crate for OS Information
**Rationale**: The sysinfo crate is already used in the project for system metrics collection and provides comprehensive OS information through its `System::name()`, `System::version()`, etc. methods. It's cross-platform and maintains consistency with existing codebase patterns.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **std::env::consts**: Only provides basic compile-time constants (ARCH, OS), insufficient detail
- **hostname crate**: Already used in project but only provides hostname, not comprehensive OS info
- **libc direct calls**: Would require unsafe code, violates memory safety constitution
- **uname system calls**: Platform-specific, would need conditional compilation

## Decision: Static OS Information Loading
**Rationale**: OS information (name, version, architecture, kernel) doesn't change during server runtime, so it should be collected once during application startup and cached. This aligns with FR-007 requirement and improves performance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Real-time collection**: Unnecessary overhead since OS info is static
- **SSE streaming**: OS info doesn't change, no need for real-time updates
- **On-demand collection**: Would add latency to API responses

## Decision: Extend Existing ServerInfo Structure
**Rationale**: The existing metrics system likely has a ServerInfo or similar structure that can be extended with OS details. This maintains consistency with current data model patterns.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Separate OSInfo endpoint**: Would fragment the status page data model
- **Embed in ServerMetrics**: OS info is static, shouldn't be in dynamic metrics
- **New independent service**: Over-engineering for simple static data

## Decision: Frontend Integration via Existing Status Page
**Rationale**: Add OS information section to existing `/status` page layout, maintaining design consistency and user experience flow.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Separate OS info page**: Would fragment user experience
- **Modal/popup display**: Less accessible and visible
- **Sidebar display**: Would disrupt existing responsive layout

## Implementation Pattern: Constitutional Compliance
**TDD Approach**: 
1. Write failing tests for OS info API endpoint
2. Write failing tests for frontend OS display  
3. Implement backend OS collection
4. Implement frontend OS rendering
5. Verify all tests pass

**Memory Safety**: All operations use safe Rust through sysinfo crate abstractions, no unsafe code required.

**Performance**: OS info collected once at startup, cached in memory, zero runtime overhead for repeated requests.
