# Feature Specification: Server Status Page

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-user-interface`  
**Created**: 21 September 2025  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: User description: "The user interface should have page showing server status that can be navigated to from the nav bar"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description provided: Server status page accessible via navigation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Identified: users, navigation, server status display, page routing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Server metrics clarified: memory usage, CPU usage, uptime, networking metrics
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Update frequency clarified: every 5 seconds
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Target user clarified: competent computer users
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow: navigate to status page and view server information
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Server status data entity identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No clarifications remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a competent computer user monitoring the application, I want to access a dedicated server status page through the navigation bar so that I can view detailed server metrics including memory usage, CPU usage, uptime, and networking statistics with graphical representations that update every 5 seconds.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on any page of the application, **When** I click on the "Status" link in the navigation bar, **Then** I should be taken to a server status page
2. **Given** I am on the server status page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I should see current server metrics (memory usage, CPU usage, uptime, networking statistics) displayed with graphical representations
3. **Given** I am viewing the server status page, **When** 5 seconds pass, **Then** the metrics should automatically update to show current values
4. **Given** the server metrics include numerical data, **When** I view the status page, **Then** appropriate metrics should be displayed as graphs, charts, or visual indicators rather than text only
5. **Given** I am on the status page, **When** I navigate away and return, **Then** the status information should resume updating every 5 seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the server is experiencing issues while viewing the status page?
- How does the status page behave when there are connectivity issues?
- What information is shown if status data is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated server status page accessible via URL routing
- **FR-002**: Navigation bar MUST include a clearly labeled link/button to access the server status page
- **FR-003**: Server status page MUST display memory usage, CPU usage, uptime, and networking metrics
- **FR-004**: Status metrics MUST update automatically every 5 seconds without user intervention
- **FR-005**: Metrics MUST be presented with graphical representations (charts, graphs, or visual indicators) where appropriate for numerical data
- **FR-006**: Status page MUST be designed for competent computer users who understand technical metrics
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle cases where status information is unavailable or cannot be retrieved
- **FR-008**: Navigation to status page MUST be consistent with existing application navigation patterns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Server Status**: Represents current operational state including memory usage (RAM consumption), CPU usage (processor load), uptime (time since last restart), and networking metrics (bandwidth, connections, throughput)
- **Navigation Item**: Represents the clickable element in the navigation bar that routes to the status page
- **Metric Update**: Represents the 5-second interval data refresh cycle for real-time status monitoring
