# Research: Server Status Page

## System Metrics Collection in Rust

**Decision**: Use `sysinfo` crate for cross-platform system metrics collection  
**Rationale**: Provides consistent API for memory, CPU, and network statistics across platforms; well-maintained with good performance; integrates well with async Rust  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Direct `/proc` filesystem access (Linux-only, less portable)
- `psutil` bindings (Python dependency, heavier)
- Manual system calls (complex, error-prone)

## Real-time Data Streaming

**Decision**: Extend existing SSE infrastructure for metrics streaming  
**Rationale**: Project already has SSE implementation for time updates; consistent pattern for users; leverages existing connection management  
**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSocket connections (more complex, overkill for one-way data)
- Long polling (less efficient, higher latency)
- REST API with client-side polling (inefficient, inconsistent intervals)

## Metrics Display and Visualization

**Decision**: Use Chart.js for graphical representations in Svelte components  
**Rationale**: Lightweight, well-documented, good Svelte integration; supports real-time updates; wide variety of chart types  
**Alternatives considered**:
- D3.js (more complex, steeper learning curve)
- Native SVG/Canvas (reinventing the wheel, maintenance burden)
- Plotly.js (heavier bundle size, more features than needed)

## Frontend Page Structure

**Decision**: Create new SvelteKit route `/status` with dedicated component  
**Rationale**: Follows existing SvelteKit routing patterns; easy navigation integration; maintains SPA structure  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Modal/popup overlay (less accessible, harder to bookmark)
- Sidebar component (UI complexity, space constraints)
- Iframe embedding (security concerns, styling issues)

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Cache metrics for 1-second intervals, serve cached data to multiple clients  
**Rationale**: Reduces system load from frequent metric collection; provides consistent data to all users; acceptable latency for monitoring use case  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Real-time collection per request (high system load)
- Longer cache intervals (reduces responsiveness)
- Per-client collection (doesn't scale)

## Security Considerations

**Decision**: No authentication required for metrics endpoint (monitoring data)  
**Rationale**: System metrics are operational data, not sensitive business data; simplifies implementation; consistent with existing public status patterns  
**Alternatives considered**:
- JWT-based authentication (adds complexity for monitoring use case)
- API key protection (operational overhead)
- Role-based access (over-engineering for system metrics)

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with placeholder values for unavailable metrics  
**Rationale**: Maintains page functionality even if some metrics fail; provides clear user feedback; prevents complete page failure  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Hard failure on metric collection errors (poor user experience)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (adds complexity for simple monitoring)
- Silent failures (user confusion, debugging difficulty)
